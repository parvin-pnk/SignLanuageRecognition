# SignLanuageRecognition
The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize hand gestures through Computer Vision (specifically, using the cvzone library). Additionally, I have implemented a feature for a Dynamical Dataset, allowing users to add more sign symbols to the dataset.
